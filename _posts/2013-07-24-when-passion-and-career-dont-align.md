This afternoon, I visited a younger brother of mine who lives in Hledan. We met at a tea shop, where I also had the pleasure of meeting one of his friends—an Assistant Lecturer from Mandalay Technological University. I learned that he had recently resigned from his post.

Since we shared the same major, the conversation flowed easily. He shared that he had left his teaching position at the university and was preparing to move to Singapore. Currently, he is attending networking courses in Yangon.

In this era, even university teachers find it difficult to sustain themselves domestically, leading many to seek employment abroad. It would be ideal if one could find a job that matches their field of study. However, having to switch paths and start from scratch in a different field after graduation is a waste of accumulated knowledge. It is also a significant loss for the nation’s education sector.

I wonder how many teachers are currently planning to resign and head overseas. Furthermore, the likelihood of them re-entering the academic field upon their return to Myanmar is incredibly low. Even within the country, there are countless former teachers who have turned their backs on education to pursue livelihoods in other sectors.

I consider such occurrences a massive loss of human resources for the country’s education sector.
