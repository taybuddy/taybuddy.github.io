The more I noticed, the more time I had to prepare, and while I was reflecting, I came up with this article.

One of the things that I learned in Myanmar is that I don't know what to ask. For example, in the classroom, when the teacher asks, "What else do you want to ask?", I don't have anything to ask. I don't know what kind of questions to ask because I don't dare to ask.

It's the same in the workplace. If my seniors don't tell me what to do and what responsibilities to take, it's hard to understand right away what the two of them are showing. "Chek Chek" is a sound that does not light up the eardrums, and every time I think about it, I think, "Am I slow in learning, am I weak in concentration?" I have been discouraged in the classroom.

I think for a moment... I have a self-study subject. Instead of relying on them and asking, I have become a companion to the books. The Internet has become a real refuge for insecurity. I have searched and collected the necessary books and reference documents myself. I have searched and searched in blogs and forums.

This method may seem slow at first, but when it gets to the point where it is easy to overlook something, and there are those who are difficult to understand, but there are those who are sympathetic and understanding.

I have experienced a small embarrassment myself. When I ask someone for a task, I have experienced their numbers in a row, I have had to nod my head with a wry smile when I knew the other person was impatient and wanted to ask again.

I think that this knowledge is the highest, and it is the "empathy" that arises spontaneously from the attitude of patiently explaining and suggesting numbers in threes and fours to make it easier for the other person to remember.

"Not knowing what to ask" may seem like a trivial matter to others, but it is a really frustrating issue for the person concerned. I have experienced and felt this myself, and I can share it with such empathy,
