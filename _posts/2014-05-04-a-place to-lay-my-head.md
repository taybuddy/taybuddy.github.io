Today, five of us friends finally managed to sign a six-month lease for a small apartment on Pansodan Street in downtown Yangon. The rent is 150,000 Kyats per month—totaling 900,000 Kyats for the six months—and that’s not even counting the extra month’s rent we had to pay as a broker fee. My upcoming bonus, which I had hoped to give to my parents as a gesture of gratitude, will now have to go straight toward the rent instead.

In Yangon, perhaps the traditional priority of "Food, Clothing, Shelter" should be rearranged to "Shelter, Food, Clothing." 

> Finding just enough space to lay one’s head has become the most pressing priority.

Life as a renter is never easy. You have to stay on top of guest registrations (overnight guest lists), and keep up with electricity bills, water fees, and municipal taxes. Then there’s the final struggle: when it’s time to move out, you often have to spend your own money to restore the place to its original condition to satisfy the landlord.

But it doesn't end there. When people from different backgrounds live together, there are the daily frictions—competing for the bathroom, forgetting to switch on the water pump, or waiting for someone else to take out the trash. It’s a constant exercise in patience and compromise.

Despite all this, I can breathe a sigh of relief for the next six months knowing I have a roof over my head. Amidst these burdens, I still have to keep working toward my dream: bringing my parents from our hometown to Yangon for a proper medical check-up.
