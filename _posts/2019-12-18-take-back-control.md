Watching the movie Brexit made me realize just how vital a slogan is to a campaign (or any business, for that matter). The film interestingly portrays how the famous Brexit slogan actually came to be.

Daniel Hannan, one of the leaders of the Brexit Campaign, was searching for a slogan that could capture the essence of their message concisely. He believed that a slogan shouldn't just be a mere shout; it needs to resonate deeply with people’s emotions.

> A slogan is more than just a cry; it must align closely with people's feelings.

One night, while reading the book So You're Going To Be A Dad before bed, he found his inspiration. He was struck by a phrase in the book: "To feel like you want to go back to being in control."

Drawing from that phrase, Daniel moved beyond a simple "Take Control" and opted for the much more powerful "Take Back Control"—eventually becoming the full slogan, "Let's Take Back Control."

This slogan perfectly articulated the public’s desires and became a primary driving force in the success of the Brexit campaign.
