Self-Examination: A Reflection

“Examine your own mind. Examine your own mind. Examine your own mind.”

I came across this motto this morning while taking the special express bus from Myaynigone. Long after I got off the bus, those words kept echoing in my thoughts. Perhaps it was because of how brief they were, yet how deeply they cut to the chase.

In our religious teachings, there is a saying: "Stay mindful of the present moment." I feel that this phrase—"Examine your own mind"—carries that exact same essence. What is happening to me right now? Am I being overcome by greed? Am I boiling with anger? Am I harboring envy toward others? Or perhaps, amidst life’s hardships, am I overthinking and falling into despair?

Only when we can audit our own minds do our perspectives become clear. And only with clarity can we discern right from wrong. As Sayadaw U Jotika once put it, it is about "finding clarity within the chaos."

However, it is always easier said than done. Putting this into practice is no small feat. This is likely why we have the proverb: "Aware of the truth, yet deep in the habit" (meaning it is hard to change even when we know better).

In this modern era, people's characters seem to be deteriorating as egos grow larger. Even though we are all just trying to provide for ourselves and our families, some seem to find a twisted satisfaction in gains that come only at the expense of others—through betrayal or through someone else’s tears.

As I reflected on the words "Examine your own mind," I found myself sighing repeatedly. There have been many times when I remained silent despite knowing something was unjust, or times when I stepped into trouble knowing full well the consequences.

“Examine your own mind. Examine your own mind. Examine your own mind.”

It’s so easy to say, yet so incredibly difficult to live by.
